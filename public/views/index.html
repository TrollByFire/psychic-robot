        This will be a single-page application which will consume an API that
        has not yet been developed.  As more work is done, this file will likely
        change extensively in the various topic branches that will be created.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact, at some point, we will likely be using a view engine such as
        jade.  We will be hooking up stylus, preferably as middleware for the
        server itself, and have compilation and caching handled server-side.
